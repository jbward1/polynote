Text Cells provide a Rich Text Editing experience, allowing you to edit and format text as you type it, like editing a
document. 

The [Text Toolbar](toolbar.md#text-cells) contains standard Rich Text Editing elements: 

- Text style (Heading, Paragraph, etc.)
- Emphasis (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough)
- List (unordered, ordered)
- Indentation

It also contains a few non-Standard options.

### Code and Links

The **code** button tags the currently-selected text as `code`, formatting it as monospaced. 

The **link** button tags the currently-selected text as a link. Clinking on a link will reveal the URL in a tooltip, 
allowing you to navigate to the website.

### LaTeX Editor

You can also input `LaTeX` into your text cells, using the button that looks like a Sigma.
