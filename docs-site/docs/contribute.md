## Issues and Documentation

You can contribute to the Polynote project without writing a single line of code! We also need help with writing and
maintaining documentation, and with user testing. Documentation pull requests can be submitted to the [main repository](https://github.com/polynote/polynote/)
(you'll find the documentation in markdown format in the [`docs` directory](https://github.com/polynote/polynote/tree/master/docs)). We'd also appreciate [issue reports](https://github.com/polynote/polynote/issues)
that you find while using the software.
